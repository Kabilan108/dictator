<project-description>
You are building dictator - a wails app that provides speech-to-text via whisper.cpp.
The will primarily be used on an ubuntu machine running a custom i3 desktop environment.
The app will primarily be a floating window that has a rectangular fixed aspect ratio with
controls for recording and a waveform visualizer beside the controls.
The app needs to be able to start a whisper-server instance and communicate with it for STT.
It should include a separate settings window that will allow the user to configure the whisper-server settings.
This should also support using remote backends for the whisper-server.
